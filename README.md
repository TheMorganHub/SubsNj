# SubsNj
SubsNJ is a subtitle synchronisation and editing tool 100% made in Java.
It can even read and repair(1) files with formatting errors!

Compatible formats are SRT and SUB; the two most widely used nowadays.

Potential upcoming features if I've got time:
* Ability to edit subtitles within SubsNj - Done! since v1.0.1
* Support for more formats
* Convert between formats (SUB are already automatically converted to SRT!)

Feedback is welcome and appreciated!

-Made with lots of warm Java by Morgan <3

*(If you're only looking for the executable, go to /store folder and look for subsNj.jar)

(1) SubsNj will only attempt to repair SRT files, and not all formatting errors are repairable.
